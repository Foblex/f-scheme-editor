### Our Contributing Philosophy

The direction of Foblex Scheme Editor, including which new features are added and which are left out, is decided by the core team. Although we don‚Äôt offer financial compensation, we deeply value the contributions from the community. Your efforts in fixing bugs, adding new features, and improving the library are highly appreciated.

Foblex Scheme Editor thrives because of the community that uses, shares, and discusses it. Non-code contributions are some of the most valuable and often overlooked aspects of open source, and we especially welcome help in these areas.

### How can I help?

We need help with the following:

 - üîç **Bug Reports**: We can‚Äôt catch all bugs ourselves. Check existing
   issues and discussions first, then create a new issue to report any
   bugs you find. 
 - üí¨ **Answering Questions**: Help answer questions in
   our  GitHub discussions. 
 - üìπ **Creating Tutorials**: Share your
   tutorials with us and we‚Äôll happily promote them!

All interactions should be conducted with respect and adhere to our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
