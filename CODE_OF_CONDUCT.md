### Our Commitment

We are dedicated to creating an open and welcoming environment for all participants in our project and community. Our goal is to ensure that everyone has a harassment-free experience, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, experience level, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

### Our Standards

To maintain a positive atmosphere, we encourage the following behaviors:

 - 🌟 **Using welcoming and inclusive language**
 - 🤝 **Respecting differing viewpoints and experiences**
 - 💬 **Gracefully accepting constructive criticism**
 - 🌍 **Prioritizing the well-being of the community**
 - ❤️ **Showing empathy towards other community members**

We consider the following behaviors unacceptable:

 - 🚫 **The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances**
 - ❌ **Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks**
 - 🛑 **Public or private harassment**
 - 🔒 **Publishing others’ private information without explicit permission**

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for defining and enforcing standards of acceptable behavior. They will take appropriate and fair corrective actions in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior. This includes the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not adhere to this Code of Conduct. Additionally, maintainers may ban any contributor whose behavior is deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Where appropriate, and with consent from all parties, project maintainers will strive to facilitate restorative justice over punitive actions.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Representation can include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Project maintainers may further define and clarify representation.

We ask all community members to uphold these standards to ensure a safe and welcoming space for everyone.
